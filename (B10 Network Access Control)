• B10: Network Access Control Analysis

• Learning Objectives:

• Reviewing firewall rule bases and network access control lists.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Network access control lists are used to define what traffic is allowed and not allowed to enter or leave a network. Netwrok devices such as servers and routers can filter the packets to the specified criteria in the access control lists to determine wheather or not to forward or drop the packets

Netwrok Access Control Lists:
Offer a basic level of security / Enforce restriction on traffic and resources / netwrok adminstrators use them to control traffic flow,improve netwrok performance,provide security
The two most widely used are stadnard and extended

Standard NAC:
lists are based on the principle of permitting or denying packets based on the source IP address.
access-list deny 192.168.X.9
access-list allow 192168.X.10

Extended NAC
involves permiting or denying packets based on:
Source and desination IP address / Port Numbers / Protocols / Other Parameters
e.g = access-list deny tcp 192.168.X.10 eq 80 (denies packets from the source IP .10 using the protocl TCP port 80

Firewalls:
first line of defence
Requitre extensive configuration
become vulnerable over time
Firewalls can be hardware or software based and can be installed in various locations on a netwrok. E.G they might be host machines,servers or dedicated firewall devices. Mutiple firewalls can be layered in the network to provide defense in depths and breadth tatics.

Rules :
Allow/block specific netwrok traffic
inbound rules (WAN to LAN)
Outbound rules (LAN to WAN)
WAN restrictions for internal sources

A firwewall has two default rules: one for ibound traffic and one for outbound. Defualt rules of the moderb routers are :
INBOUND: Block access from outside expecept responses from the LAN side
Outbound: Allow all access from the LAN side to the outside.

Question and Answers

Describe netwrok access control lists =  they define the restriction on inbound and outbound traffic [ what traffic is allowed and not allowed to enter or leave a netwrok]

Best Describe firewall outbound rules = They specify the restriction on what internal sources can access outside the local area network [the outbound rules describe the restrictions on what internal sources an accesss outside the local area.

Describe extended netwrok access control lists - Permits and denies packets based on the source and destination ip addrr portbunmber and prtotocols and oher paramteres

Descrbie the enefits of netwrok access control lists = offers a basic level of security / enforces traffic restrictions , and can improve netwrok performance

There are 2 well known types of netwrok access control lists known as what = Standard and Extended
