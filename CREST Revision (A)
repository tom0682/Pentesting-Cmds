A1: Engagement Lifecycle Management:

Learning Objectives: 
Benefits and utility of penetration testing to the client
Structure of penetration testing, including the relevant processes and procedures
Concepts of infrastructure testing and application testing, including black box and white box formats
Project closure and debrief

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

White Hat / Black Hat / Grey Hat
White Box - Privided with Knowledge (IP addresses with Creds)
Black Box - Provided with no knowledge - Simulates real world

Phases of Pen Testing:
-Recon : Passive info gathering techniques - Web, Dumpster Diving
-Scanning and Enum -  Ping Sweeps /  Port Scan / Vulnerbility scan / Users and network shares
-Exploitation Exploiting weakness and vulns
-Maintaing Access Using Rootkits and backdoors
-Reporting -Detailed Findings

Pentesting Frameworks:
Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM)
Information systems Security Assesment Framework (ISSAF)
Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)
NIST 800-115
Open Web Application security project (OWASP)

OSSTMM: 
Helps to improve the standard and quality of pentests
Detailed five key areas: Human Security Testing / Physical Security testing / Wireless Security Testing / Telecom Sec testing / Data Networks sec testing.

OWASP:
Intro and objectevies / Info Gathering / Config and Deployment Management Testing / Identity Managment Testing / Authentication Testing / Authourization Testing
Session management Testing / Input validation Testing / Error handling / Cryptography / Business Logi Testing / Client Side Testing.

Project Closure and Debrief:(usually most important stage as this is how the client will judge your work and moves forward with you)
Completed Methodology:
PMBOK - Close Project Phase / Close Procurement
Report
Evaluation
(finalising all activites to formally close the project)
High level overview and technical overview (2 reports usually) one for managers and one for techies this is important for lesson learned and what went well.

Close Project Phase:
Finalising all activities to complete the project or or phase:
Handing over all Deliverables
Final user / Customer Approval
Maintance and operational arrangements
Notifying personnnel of resources release then releasing and returning resources
Closing registers/logs and closing files
Comparing achievement against baseline
preparing and holding the post project review 
Schedule the benefits review (Project sponsor responsbility)
Procurment Audits (Close Procurments)

Close Procurment ( makes sure both sides have met the contractioal obligation and verfies that all work produced is acceptable)
Resolves any outstanding issues
Verifies all and deliverables produced is acceptable
updates the records and arhives information for the future use/audit
Early termination of a contract (or part of) can arise from:
Mutal agreement of the parties or
Default of one of the parties
Buyer may have the right to temrinate all or part of a contract for cause or convience at any time, but may have to compensate the selller for preperations, partial completions and completed / accepted work

A2: Law & Compliance:

Learning Objectives:

Knowledge of pertinent UK legal issues:
Computer Misuse Act 1990
Human Rights Act 1998
Data Protection Act 1998
Police and Justice Act 2006
Impact of this legislation on penetration testing activities.
Awareness of sector-specific regulatory issues.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Legal System: by country it varies;
European Union - Goverened by EU Directives / Directives are integrated into member states legal systems / Interpretation can lead to differences
US Laws: Fedral law and State Law (meaning state to state it can vary)
Businesses need to work across mutiple legal systems / Ignorance of another countrys legistation is not an excuse (ISO standard follow a good framework)

Privacy Laws: protection of personal data
European union / One overarching Data protection act / DPA implemented in the UK (Data protection act of 1998)
US- Sector based fedral statutes / HIPAA

GDPR Basics- Applied to UK from 25th May 2018
Applies to : Controllers - say how and why personal data is processed / contracts with the processors must comply with the GDPR
  Processors: Acts on the controllers behalf / more legal libitilities

PECR: privacy and electronic communcation regualtion
There are specific rules on marketing calls / emails /text and faxes
cookies (and simular tech)
Keeping communication services secure
cusomter privacy as regards to trafffic and lcoation data, itmeised billing , line idenctification and directory listings

Safeguarding Data: Privacy shield Framework - Protect the fundemental rights of Europeans / Ensure legal certainty for businesses (US to EU data)

Computer misuse act 1990 - unathourised access to a computer / unathourised access with the intent to facilitate further offenses / Unauthrised modification of computer material (this also applie to mobiles and tablets)

Human Rights Act 1998 - The rights and freedoms that belong to all indivduals / maintain a fair civilised socicety / cover rights in your everyday life such as speech / beliefs / right to a faair trial

police and Justice act 2006 - Establish the national policing improvement agency, the act coveres Police forces / Police authorities pension powers the powers and duties of communty support officers

Sector specific Regulations: Targeted at a specific industries intended to control aspects of operation unique to that sector
FDA provisions for pharmaceutical sector / PCI-DSS regulations for the storgare of credit card information.

QUESTION AND ANSWERS:
What protects the data of customers across the UK, Europe and America? = Privacy sheild (on the 2nd Feb 2016 the European commision and the US agreed on new framework for transalantic data flows:the EU-US Privacy Shield)
Explain the Human Rights Act = The rights and freedoms that belong to all indivduals regardless of  their nationality an citizenship (they are fundamnetally important in maintainging a far and civilised society
What does GDPR stand for? = Genral Data protection Regulation ( From May 2018 this regualtion was enforced within the EU and UK)
What Regulations are there for companies who handle cardholder data? = PCI-DSS (all compnaies who use or sotre cardholder data are regulated by the payment card industry)
The Police and Justic act of 2006 is an act to establish which group? = National policing improvement agency ( to make a provision about the police forces and authorities and about police pensions to make provision about police powers and abouth the powers and duties of communty support officers

A3: Scoping 
Learning Objectives:

Understanding client requirements.
Scoping project to fulfil client requirements.
Accurate timescale scoping.
Resource planning.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ISAFF
Phase 1 - Planning and preperation (ag
Phase 2 - Assesment (info gathering / Network mapping / Vuln ID / Penetration / Gaining access and Priv esc / Enum further what other processes are running? / compromise Remote users or sites by manipulating trusts / Maintaing access / cover tracks
Phase 3 - Reporting / Clean Upand Destroy Artefacts (Reporting can be Verbal and written, Notify the appropriate stakeholders)

Reporting: Managment summary (key findings and recommendations
project scope - reminds the customer what was agreed in the phase 1 terms of engadgments
Penetration test tools used - what has occured on their systems 
Exploits used during your penetration test
data and time of the tests
all output of the tools and exploits
A list of identified vulnerbilties mitigate identified vulnerbilties
Recommendations to identified vulns

Clean up: Remove all test info / if it cant be removed detail the info in the technical report 

Rules of Engagements (often used the OSSTMM)

Question and Answers:
All info that is created and stored on the tested systems should be removed in which ISSAF  phase? = Phase 3 (Clean up and destroy Artefacts)
what section form the ISSAF reminds the client of what was agreed in the terms of engagement? = Project Scope ( a documented agreement which can be refered to at any time during the engagement.
Which is not applicable when dealing with pen tests NCSC / ISSAF / OSSTMM / OISSG = NCSC (Although the national Cyber Security centre may be able to offer somesupport and guidance this is not the correct answer)
What is pahse 3 of a pentest according to the ISSAF ? = Reporting , clean up and Destro Artefacts (OISSG cover the steps in their manual)
what is the primary benefit of using OSSTMM? = It is open source tried and tested manual
what is the last layer of pahse 2 according to the ISSAF? = Covering Tracks ( An essential step is eliminatiing anything you have done inside the system or network to this point, Hiding key files clearing logs, removing the circumnavigationof any integrity checks and in some cases re-enabling the antivirus solution
According to OSSTMM what are the pahses of testing? = Induction / Interaction / Inquest and Intervention ( These are pahses of the pen test project that can be used for implementation, execution or auditing purposes as required

A5: Record Keeping, Interim Reporting & Final Results 
Learning Objectives:

Understanding reporting requirements.
Understanding the importance of accurate and structured record keeping during the engagement.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why is documentation important? Provides a record of the actions performed / Helps Trace your steps / Aids in report writings (must include screenshot and provide enough info so a 3rd party could re-create the steps)

What to include? - Dates and time / Actions perfomred / Tools used incl version numbers / Executed cmds / Findings incl screenshots / Risk Ratings / Recommendations

Report writing stages: 4 stages
1- Report Planning - objectives of the penetration test , purpose of the report, your target audience, presentation and style
2- Collection of information - in regards to the methods used,tools,and their version numbers , scanning results, vulnerbility assesments and details of your findings
3- Writing the Draf Report - Detail the activities, processes, findings and recommendations
4- Report Finalisation - Involves proof reading to identify any mistakes in relation to technical facts, Spelling, grammar and presentation


Types of Reports:
Executive Summary report (Chief grade jobs summarises the test in small and consise info pie charts and graphs are often used normally just including the recommendation and risk to the business)
Management Sumary - summarises the repeort to in relation regualrity and compliatary measurments to the security of the business
Technical Summary - the technical minded SME of the business
