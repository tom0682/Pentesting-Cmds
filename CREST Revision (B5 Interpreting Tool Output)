B5: Interpreting Tool Output 
Learning Objectives:

Interpreting output from port scanners, network sniffers and other network enumeration tools.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Know you nmap outout for this module the diffrence between - Open / Closed / filtered and Unfiltered

Know what Wireshark is and how to use it. What the tool is showing you all the different pannels (Packet List Packet details and Packet Bytes)

Network Enumeration - Network Miner
Netwrok sniffer and enum tol developed by Netresec
There are 2 version of network miner - Open source free and professioanl paid with additional feature
Network miner is a Network Forensic Analysis Tool (NFAT) for windows but also works in linux and Mac osx and Free BSD
Network Miner can be used as a passive netwrok sniffer/packet capturer tool in order to detec operating systems, sessions , hostnames, open ports
etc. Without putting any traffic on the network. Network Miner can also parse PCAP files for off line analysis and to regenerate/reassemble
transmitted files and certificates from PCAP files. This tool makes it easy to perform advanced netwrok traffic analysis (NTA) by providing extracted
artifacts in an intutitive user interface. The way the data is presented not only makes the analysis simplerer it also saves valuble time for the investigator
This tool has become popular by incident response teams as well as law enforcement.

Operating System enum using P0f
Monitors, captures and examines traffic
attempts tro identify the operating system

command = p0f -i eth0 -p

SMB Enumeration
command = nbtscan 192.168.X.X      will deterime the NetBios name
command= nbtscan -hv 192.168.X.X will determine the SMB services and workgroup
coomand = nmap --script smb-enum-shares.nse -p445 <IPADDRR> use the nmap nse SMB script to enumerate SMB

SNMP Enumeration
command= nmap -sU -p 161 --script=snmp-win32-users <TARGET>
command = snmpwalk -c public -v1 <target> 1.3.6.1.4.1.77.1.2..25      snmp user query

Question and Answers:

What tool would give the output of Iso.3..6.1.4.1.77.1.2.25.1.1.4.72.111.109.101 = STRING:HOME? = SNMPWALK

Sec analysts can make use of port scan to determine what? = Determine what ports are open,closed,filtered and unflitlered on a host

During a port scan if the results show a port as being closed then we can assume that the host is doing what? = Accessible but there is no applicaiton listening on it

Network Miner and P0f are two tools known for what? = Operating system fingerprinting

NetwrokMiner has simular functionalities to which other tool? = Wireshark Both network miner and wireshark both can capture and analyse traffic

What is the expected outcome of nbtscan 192.168.X.X = NetBios name

During a port scan if the results show a port as being filtered the we can assume that the host is doing what? = Filtering packets if a port is filtered then we know that nmap is unable to establish wheather the port is open this maybe  due to a firewall filtering packets before it reaches the port.

during a port scan if the result show a prot as being closed then we can assume that the host is doing what? = Accessible but there is no application listening on it

Angry IP scanner is a tool predomitely used for what?  = Ping sweeping tool.

Describe an unfiltered port result = Accesible but nmap cannot determin if its open or closed

Describe a filtered port result : if a port is reported as filtered then we know that nmp is unable to establish weather the port is open this may be due to a firewalll filtering packets before it reaches the port
