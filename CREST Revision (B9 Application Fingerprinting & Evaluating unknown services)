Application Fingerprinting is a term used to describe the technique of identifying the version of operating systems,applicaitons adn services running on a host.

Applicaiton fingerpringting has both legitimate and illegitmate uses fore example it can be used by network admins to collect information for managment purposes and it can be used by attackers to identifiy vulnerbale hosts,.

Banner Grabbing - Is a technique used to gain information about a computer system on a network that is runniong the service on a targets system. This type of infomration can be very useful to netwrok admins, intrusion anaylsts and even more so to a malicious hackers,as it can be used to dertiminewheather or not the service is upto date or vulnerable to attack.

nc -nv <ipaddrress ><port number>

Can use telnet or netcat.

Banner grabbing is often one of the first port of calls for an attacker as this type of information enables them to research the aplicaiton and its version to see if there are any unknown vulnerbilitites or applicable exploits that have been published.

**Make sure you know the namp switches for services discovery and OS discovery**

using the nmap nse to obtain useful infomation on services and applicaitons

nmap --script[SCRIPT NAME] [IPADDRR]
nmap --script=ms-sql-info -p 1433 192.168.X.X
smb-os-discovery
http_server_header
snmp_info
ircServerinfo
showSSHversion
