B4: Network Mapping & Target Identification 

Learning Objectives:

Analysis of output from tools used to map the route between the engagement point and a number of targets.
Network sweeping techniques to prioritise a target list and the potential for false negatives.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Techniques used by security admins and personell to determine what hosts are live on a network within a given IP range.

Determine yuor boundires - Establish your target Host / Understand the network infrstructre
Be organised - Create list based outputs
Adhere to scoping documents - Be carful what u scan

As a security person one of the main importance of network mapping is to gain an understanding of the structre of the netwrok in order to determin your boundires and to establish what hosts are alive, Once you have establshed all live hosts on the netwrok you can begin to create a priotised list of your target hosts, in accordance to scoping document. The list will aid your security assesment and ensure that you do not perform scans on hosts that are out of the scope.

Network mapping and Target ID 
Generate alot of network traffic
Techniques and tools used by hackers
May cause false positives to security systems

Ping Scan - Quickly determine live hosts / Generate less netwrok traffic / Generate list of live hosts
In simple terms: 
192.168.X.X - Reply Recived = Live Host
192.168.X.X - No Reply =No Host

Once a ping scan has been performed we can then create a list of live hosts only of which we can specifically target to perform more advanced scans, this whole process help to prevent sending data to IP addresses that do not have live hosts.

**Revise Nmap for this section**

Questions and answers

1)Which of the following DOES NOT describe the features of NMAP?
it is a cmd line tool only 
its free open source tool
it is available for windows and linux systems 
it is used to map network
= it is a command line tool only.

2) what will the following nmap cmd do? “nmap -sn 192.168.0.0/24”? = Pings all the IP range of 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.0.255

3) name a ping sweeping tool alternative to NMAP = Angry IP scanner and Advanced IP scanner

4) Which of the following DOES NOT describe the features of a ping Scan?
None of these
Quickly determines live hosts
Generates less netwrok traffic than other types of scan
can help to generate a list of live hosts
=None of these (Ping scans are used to quickly determine what hosts are live on a network without generating too much traffic

5) which of the following DOES NOT describe the features of network mapping?
None of these
Determine boundries
Establish live hosts on a network
provides an understadning of the structre of teh network
=None of these ( network mapping allows to map the network to gain an understanding of the structre of the network in order to determin your boundries and to establish what host are live

6)During a ping scan if a reply is recived back from a host then we assume the host is doing what? = up(live)

7)Sec analysts can use network mapping techniques to identfiy what?
What OS syste3ms are running?
What hosts are live on a netwrok
what users are live on a network
what services are running on hosts on a netwrok
=What hosts are live on a network

8)During a ping scan if we recived NO replies from a host then we can assume that the host is doing what= Down(not live)

9)what is the name of NMAP GUI tool? = Zenmap

10)What does the parameter -sn instruct nmap to do? =To Perform a Ping Scan
