CAT 5 
ANSI/TIA/EIA-568-A with clarification in TSB-95
8P8C modular connections (RJ45)
Cable termination either T568A or T568B CAT5 vs 5e

CAT5 cable is used to connect network devices on a local area network e.g workstation to router

CAT6:gigabyte etherenet / backwards compatible / Faster Performance / Reduced max length / limited to 100M

Fibre technology: Data carried by using entirely optical light based tech
Cable types: Modes /Single mode / Multi Mode / Gastroscope 

10/110/1000 base T
Twister pair cables
Speeds: 10mbps/100/1000
IEEE 802.3

Wireless 802.11
wireless LAN standards common protocols a,b,g,n,ac


Question and asnwers:
What is the maximum length for both Cat5 and Cat 6 ? = 100 meteres

What is a subnet? = A subnet seprates different parts of a network making it easier to manage in relation to connections (a subnet is a identifiable seprate part of a netowrk)

which one of the following protocols are NOT part of IP routing RIP/TCP/OSPF/BGP = TCP ( IP routing or forwading is an umbrella term for the set of protocols that determine the path that data
follows in order to travel across mutiple networks from its source to its destination.

11101100.00000011.00000000.11011000 what is this IP address? = 236.3.0.216 to work this out write on paper from RIGHT to LEFT 1>128 (1/2/4/8/16/32/128) the add the last octate up to reveal the asnwer

what is NOT a type of NAT architecture from the following > Asymettric NAT / Address Restricted Cone / Symmetric NAT / Port Restricted Cone? = 

In the context of network architecture A collection of network resources best describes what? = A domain

In terms of Ethernet and X base-T what does the X represent? = speed 10/100/1000 Base T are ethernet standars that use twisted paid cables and operate at speed of 10/100 or 1000 mbps corresponsding to their standard.

What is the common modular connector for CAT5? = RJ45 Also known as 8P8C module connectors

Explain the purpose of NAT = Acts as an agent between the internet and local private network (this means that only a single, unique public IP address is required to represent an entire group of networked computers.
