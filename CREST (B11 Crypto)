Know the difference between encyption and encoding.

Crptogrophy can help in countering:
Unathourised access to information in an infomration system
Unathourised disclosure of info
Unathourised modification of info
Misrepenresentation of the origin of a message (spoofing who origninated a message)
Repudiation of a essage
Replay of a message.


• Confidentiality is the protection of information such that only the originator and intended recipients can see the information. In essence this means data is being encrypted. This could be data, when travelling around a network, such as an email in transit, or when encryption is used to protect information fixed at rest on a disk. Only authorised users will be able to decrypt the messages or files.


• Authentication is were the identity or authenticity of an entity (such as a user logging into a PC) is verified. The entity could be a user, message or device. User authentication normally pertains to the verification of a user’s claimed identity, whilst message authentication usually involves the recipient of a message verifying the identity of the originator.


• Integrity involves mechanisms that ensure that if data has been modified, changed or deleted, the modification can be detected. This includes detection of anyone attempting to insert data into communications traffic.


Non-repudiation protects against one party in a communication exchange claiming that it never occurred. There are various forms of non-repudiation, including non-repudiation of origin and non-repudiation of receipt.

SYMMETRIC:
Symmetric ciphers provide confidentiality using the same keys to encrypt and decrypt the data. The strength of protection lies in the secrecy of the keys and NOT in the algorithm. The details of most commercial algorithms are openly published, therefore it is assumed that attackers not only have knowledge of the algorithm but also awareness of the system they are attacking.
The challenge is to generate keys randomly and keep them protected throughout their lifecycle, particularly during use and distribution. If an attacker can guess a key, the security of the system is compromised.



What is a disadvantage of symmetric encrytption? = key management [ without the support of public key management systems the key management of symmetric systems  an be a disadvantage if you were doing key managment of symmetric keys using manual distribution methods then you run into the n(n-1)/2 problem

describe how a digital signature is created? =  The sender encrypts a message digest with his private key.

What is the primary purpose of using a digital signature? = Non-repudation [ if the sender has sole custody of the private key relating to the digiatal signature it is very difficult for the sender to deny they sent the message in the first place.
