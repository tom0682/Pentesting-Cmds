B1: IP Protocols 
Learning Objectives:

IP protocols: IPv4 and IPv6, TCP, UDP and ICMP.
Awareness that other IP protocols exist.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IPv4 uses 32bits to store an IP address, this provides over 4 billion addresses an IPv4 adress is split into 4 sections (octates)
Also contains the Network ID and the Host ID 

Public and Private addresses:
Public - class A-E 
A- 0.0.0.0 - 126.255.255.255
B- 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255
C-192.0.0.0 -239.255.255.255
D-224.0.0.0-239.255.255.255
E-240.0.0.0-255.255.255.255

Private- Class A-C 
A-10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
B-172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
C-192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255


IPv6 uses a 128 bit to sotre addresses this allows 2 to the power of 128 addresses
can be split into 8 sections

IPv6 Unicast - IP address have a one-to-one relationship
network packets are delivered to the network interface with the inicast IP address

IPv6 Multicast - they have a one-to-many relationship 


IPv6 Anycast -will send to the nearset interface to them.

ICMP can be used to used to repeort and diganose networking problems, often used by network admins to troubleshoot connectio problems,
such as the use of the ping command to help detect if a host is reachable or not.

Transmission Control Protocol TCP
Works alongside IP to send packets to other network devices / Uses a 3 way handshake to establish communications. It is used to send
data packets to network devices and used when all the data that is recived by the destination device needs to be guranteed
Data is divided into packets / Checksums ensure data is not corrupted / Sequence numbers detect loss and rebuild data in the correct order.

Common uses of TCP: Accessing web pages (HTTPS and HTTPS)
Uploading files to a server (FTP)
Sending Emails (SMTP)

User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
Faster transmission rates than TCP / No Error detection / No Sequnce numbers / No gurantee that the packets arrive
UDP operates at the transport layer of the OSI
Common uses of UDP: Online gaming / Media Streaming / VOIP

Domain Name System (DNS)
Maps domain names to IP addresses www.somesite.com = 1.2.3.4
DNS can be described as the worlds telephone directory where you look up a telephone number by searching for the name of the person or business u want to call.
DNS lookups / Reverse DNS lookup
Used in many web apps - Web browsers / Email / Utilities such a PING
Everytime you request a contact with a domain name,weather to access a website or send an email your computer perfoms a DNS lookup to translate the domain name into an IP addrr

DNS Queries:
Host file - Configuration file sotred locally
Local DNS - internal DNS Servers / Offices,schools,unis etc
Public DNS servers - internet service providers (ISP's)

Host File - is a config file that can store info that maps IP addresses to domain names, if there is no entry within the host file the computer will send
a request to the local DNS server to see if if it knows the answer

Local DNS Server - This might be internal, on the same network as the computer that sent the request or the the request migt need to be sent
over to the internet to a public DNS server

Internal DNS - are found in businesses,schools,Uni's etc where they are maintained to restrict access to particular websites that may be malicious or forbidden according their policy.

Public DNS - Usually manged by your ISP they have their own list of IP addresses to server name mappings for resolving DNS queiries that span a much wider range of internet addresses
They also contain the most popular domain names such a www,facebook.com resulting in these frequent queries being solved at this stage.

Queirries will bounce around the entire heirachy of these servers until the IP is found/solved or until its decided that the host does not exist.

HTTP- protocol used to exchabge information while browsing the web, uses TCP/IP to route and transfer data on port 80

HTTP REQUESTS: The two most comononly used HTTP request methods are;
GET: Used to retrieve HTML docs,scripts,images
POST: used to send data from web pages such as log in forms

HTTP RESPONSES:Common Reponse codes from the server:
401-Unathorised access - usually occurs when you have entered login creds incorrectly
404-File not found - 
500-Internal Server error

HTTPS-Secure
plays a simualr role to HTTP to exchange info to the web except the communication data is encrpyted uses TCP/IP to route and transfer data on port 443
uses secure socket layer to encrypt the data between the client and server

Differnece between the internet and the WWW
The ineternet is simply a worldwide network that millions of smaller networks can connect to.
The WWW (world wide web) is a collection of hypertext documents and media files (webpages / pictures / vids / audio files etc)

How email systems Functions:
E-mail systems have the functionality to to- 
Send emails using the the protocol SMTP simple mail transerfer protoc on port 25
Retrive emails using POP on port 110 or IMAP (internet message access protocl on port 143)

Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
Allows users to communciate with one another by sending messages and data files
Each user is requeired to have an IRC client installed on their system to connect to IRC server
Can be used for mailicious acitivities
applicaiton layer / usually port 6667

SMB Server Message Block
Allws the sharing of files,folders,printers,serial ports and various comms between devices on a local area network.
The directories that are made accessible to other users on a network are known as shares.
SMB has been known to have a number of well known vulns.
The protocol uses both TCP and UDP usual via port 445

Questions and answers:
What is the role of DHCP? = It is used to automatically assign IP configs to devices on a netowrk
IPv4 can be split into 2 parts which are what? Netowrk ID and Host ID
Describe an IPv6 Unicast address = One-to-one relationship
which protocols are used to access web pages on the world wide web? = HTTP/HTTPS
what is the role of DNS? = It is used to map domain names to IP addresses on the internet
The letter S in the term of HTTPS is what? = Secure
What port does SMTP typically use? = port 25
port number of HTTP? = 80
